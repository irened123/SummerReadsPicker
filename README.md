## Introduction

SummerReadsPicker is a recommendation system designed to help you build your summer reading wishlist. It features five genres and provides top three book recommendations for each genre. The system includes an autocomplete feature for genre suggestions based on the text you type, and offers information such as author, ratings from the Boston Public Library, and three keywords for each book. Users can view, add, and delete items from their wishlist.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the Codecademy [python-data-structures-and-algorithms](https://github.com/Codecademy/python-data-structures-and-algorithms) repository. While some of the user input structures and formatting ideas were adapted, all code in this repository has been written independently to avoid direct duplication. 

In addition, information and recommendations for summer reading were sourced from the Boston Public Library website in May 2024. For more details, please visit: [Boston Public Library](https://www.bpl.org/).
